    "# Replication Baskaran & Hessami (2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This replication is work in progress, tentative and incomplete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a replication of Baskaran, T., & Hessami, Z. (2018) Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics? *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 10(3): 91-121.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, first, data and method used as well as the key results are summarized briefly. Second, descriptive and graphical analyses are presented in preparation of third, a replication of the key results of the paper which is accompanied by critical review of the results presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Excecutive summary of the paper\n",
    "* **Observation:** *Anti-female voter bias* results in **underrepresentation of females in politics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Research Hypothesis:** Exposure to a female mayor deminishes *anti-female biases* of voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Other potential drivers of this observation:\n",
    "        - Political parties influence election outcomes. Thus, underrepresentation might be caused by *anti-female party biases*\n",
    "        - Parties might anticipate *anti-female voter bias* and, therefore, are less willing to field female candidates in competitive races.\n",
    "        - Women who expect discrimination might be reluctand to run for election/ pursue a career in politics in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Isolating *anti-female voter bias*: Rule out alternative explanations\n",
    "        - (a) Initial ranks of candidates does not impact their rank advancements\n",
    "        - (b) Characteristics of women on party's list chage only little in case there is a female mayor in office\n",
    "        - (c) Number of female candidates on list remains unchanged\n",
    "        - (a), (b), and (c) indicate little *anti-female party bias*\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Data on local council election in the German state of Hesse.\n",
    "        - Open-list electoral system (parties specify order of candidates, voters can preferential votes to individual candidates).\n",
    "        - Includes gender, list ranks, personal characteristics among other information for ~109.017 candidates who competed in 2001, 2006, 2011, or 2016 elections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Data on mayor elections for all 426 municipalities in Hesse, including the elected mayor's gender and the margin the election was won by.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Authors use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal effects of female mayors on subsequent council election results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The discontinuity is provided by close mixed-gender mayoral elections.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * estimated model equation: \n",
    "     > $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t} = \\alpha + \\beta female \\, mayor_{i, t} + f(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + female \\, mayor_{i, t} \\times  g(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + \\epsilon_{k, i, t}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where \n",
    "         - $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t}$ is the normalized rank improvement of candidate $k$ in municipality $i$ and local election year $t$.\n",
    "         - $vote \\, margin_{i, t}$ is the margin of victory of the female candidate in the preceeding mayoral election (negative values, thus, denote a loss of the female candidate).\n",
    "         - $female \\, mayor_{i, t}$ is a dummy that takes value 1 if a female candiate has won the mayoral election preceeding the council election $(female \\, mayor_{i, t} = 1,$ *iff* $vote \\, margin_{i, t} > 0)$.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     **TODO:** This is probably the appropriate place for the causal graph representing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Results:**\n",
    "    * A female candidate winning a close mixed-gender mayoral election causes...\n",

    "This table compares characteristics of council candidates and their success in the election between the whole sample and the exclusively female subsample. There are noticeable differences in the first row \"gewinn_norm\" which provides data on the normalized rank improvement of a candidate. By showing a lower (even negative) rank improvement on average, females appear to be less successful in council elections than male candidates. \n",
    "While most of the candidates' characteristics seem to be quite similar throughout the whole sample, there is some noticeable differences when it comes to the candidates' occupations. While the share of engineers is six times higher in the whole sample then among females, more than four times as many women reported domestic work as their occupation (category \"housewifehusband\").\n",
    "While these are the most striking differences, there is smaller but still noticeable differences, e.g. in occupations \"selfemployed\" and \"retired\" (both taking higher shares for male candidates) as well as \"teacher\" and \"civil_administration\" (both higher for female candidates).\n",
    "Overall, especially with respect to age and education of the candidates, there seems to be relatively little differences as seen from this descriptive level of inspection."

    "In a first step, in order to get a better understanding of the data provided, the relationship of the margin of victory of the female mayor (abscissa) and the rank improvements of female candidates in the subsequent council election (ordinate) is illustrated (see firgure 1). For this exercise, only data on council elections that subceeded mixed gender mayor elections will be used (mayor elections in which two top candidates were of opposite gender). In addition, only rank improvements of female council candidates are of interest for this analysis and are, therefore, included in the illustration below. \n",

    "Figure 1 displayes all available combinations of the rank improvement of a female council candidate and the margin of victory od a female mayor a preceeding mixed gender election. Looking at the distributions of observed combinations, a pattern of *horizontally as well as vertically aligned datapoints* is revealed. First, since the authors work with a dataset that contains the rank improvements of each female council candidate for a given result for the preceeding mayoral election, discrete changes in the horizontal dimension are to be expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the discrete distributionof values in the vertical dimension (along the ordinate) can be explained when a closer look is taken at the distribution of council sizes: As previously described, rank improvements are normalized using the respective size of the council. While the authors do not provide data on the council sizes, this value can easily be deduced from the given values for absolute and relative gains in list ranks for the candidates. As presented in figure 2, sizes of the 214 observed councils are distributed over relatively few values and are clustered at certain values. In addition, 95 % if all councils have not more than 45 seats. It, thus, seems plausible to observe a discrete distribution of normalized rank improvements, given the discussed distibution of council sizes which will cause the denominator for the value on the ordinate to be the same for a large number of observations.\n"

    "### 2.3. Discontinuity at the Critical Value of the Margin of Victory\n",
    "Considering figure 1, it is not very obvious if there is a discontinuity around the critical value of margin of victory (i.e. a margin of 0). A jump in values on the ordinate, however, might not be visible in this graphical representation. As discussed previously, observations are not distributed continously but instead show strong discontinuities. This might result in a lot of observations being stacked on top of each other, hence not being represented in above plot.\n",
    "Another plot, adressing this problem, will be presented in the following section."

    "### 3.1 Graphical Evidence: RDD Plot\n",
    "A clear discontinuity around the cutoff value of the margin of victory of 0, however, is hard - if at all - to spot in figure 1 presented above. This might be due to the very noisy representation caused by plotting every single observation. Hence, a more promising approach is presented by the authors in *Figure 2. Rank Improvement of Female Candidates* of the article: A RDD-plot for binned normalized rank improvements. A replication of this RDD-plot is displayed in figure 3 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this plot, first, the running variable (female mayor candidate margin of victory) is limited o values from -30 to +30 %. This allows to focus on the part of the data which is most relevant for this analysis. Second, the authors decide to bin the observations into clusters of 3 percentage points width of the running variable. Third, local polynomial regression of the underlying observations is added (red line) estimating the relation of both variables.\n",

In fact, the rdrobust package does not report one single optimal bandwidth but instead reports optimal bandwidths for both, the observations on the right of the cutoff and the observations left from the cutoff, seperatly (result variables *N_r*, *N_l*).\n",
    "While other parts of the provided stata code indicate that the authors worked with an earlier version of the rdrobust package, too, earlier versions of the rdrobust package are not available on the official website (https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust/stata).\n",
