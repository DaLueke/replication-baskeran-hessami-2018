    "# Replication Baskaran & Hessami (2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This replication is work in progress, tentative and incomplete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a replication of Baskaran, T., & Hessami, Z. (2018) Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics? *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 10(3): 91-121.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, first, data and method used as well as the key results are summarized briefly. Second, descriptive and graphical analyses are presented in preparation of third, a replication of the key results of the paper.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Excecutive summary of the paper\n",
    "* **Observation:** *Anti-female voter bias* results in **underrepresentation of females in politics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Research Hypothesis:** Exposure to a female mayor deminishes *anti-female biases* of voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Other potential drivers of this observation:\n",
    "        - Political parties influence election outcomes. Thus, underrepresentation might be caused by *anti-female party biases*\n",
    "        - Parties might anticipate *anti-female voter bias* and, therefore, are less willing to field female candidates in competitive races.\n",
    "        - Women who expect discrimination might be reluctand to run for election/ pursue a career in politics in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Isolating *anti-female voter bias*: Rule out alternative explanations\n",
    "        - (a) Initial ranks of candidates does not impact their rank advancements\n",
    "        - (b) Characteristics of women on party's list chage only little in case there is a female mayor in office\n",
    "        - (c) Number of female candidates on list remains unchanged\n",
    "        - (a), (b), and (c) indicate little *anti-female party bias*\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Data on local council election in the German state of Hesse.\n",
    "        - Open-list electoral system (parties specify order of candidates, voters can preferential votes to individual candidates).\n",
    "        - Includes gender, list ranks, personal characteristics among other information for ~109.017 candidates who competed in 2001, 2006, 2011, or 2016 elections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Data on mayor elections for all 426 municipalities in Hesse, including the elected mayor's gender and the margin the election was won by.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Authors use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal effects of female mayors on subsequent council election results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The discontinuity is provided by close mixed-gender mayoral elections.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * estimated model equation: \n",
    "     > $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t} = \\alpha + \\beta female \\, mayor_{i, t} + f(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + female \\, mayor_{i, t} \\times  g(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + \\epsilon_{k, i, t}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where \n",
    "         - $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t}$ is the normalized rank improvement of candidate $k$ in municipality $i$ and local election year $t$.\n",
    "         - $vote \\, margin_{i, t}$ is the margin of victory of the female candidate in the preceeding mayoral election (negative values, thus, denote a loss of the female candidate).\n",
    "         - $female \\, mayor_{i, t}$ is a dummy that takes value 1 if a female candiate has won the mayoral election preceeding the council election $(female \\, mayor_{i, t} = 1,$ *iff* $vote \\, margin_{i, t} > 0)$.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     **TODO:** This is probably the appropriate place for the causal graph representing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Results:**\n",
    "    * A female candidate winning a close mixed-gender mayoral election causes...\n",

    "        - voters to give preferential votes to female council candidates.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - a 4 percentage points higher share of female council members.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - positive spillover effects on female council candidates in neighboring municipalities.\n",
