    "# Replication Baskaran & Hessami (2018)<a class=\"tocSkip\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a replication of [Baskaran, T., & Hessami, Z. (2018) Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics? *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 10(3): 91-121](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20170045).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, first, I present an executive summary on the article, including the research hypothesis, analyzed data and the used method. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend that one reads the original article prior to reading this notebook. Second, descriptive and graphical data analyses are presented. This is useful for understanding and making sense of the data that is used for the empirical analysis and serves as a preparation for the third part of this notebook: A replication of the key results of the paper. Besides the baseline results of the main model this includes econometric analyses regarding the internal validity of the used method as well as the robustness tests presented in the article. Subsequently, the fourth section of this notebook presents an investigation on the internal validity of the regression discontinuitiy design (henceforth RD design) which goes beyond what is presented in the article. Finally, section 5 concludes the results of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, throughout this replication I draw heavily from the original article. Unless stated otherwise, the reader should, therefore, assume that the ideas presented within this notebook are reproductions of the contents of Baskaran & Hessami (2018). \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results presented by Baskeran & Hessami (2018) can successfully be replicated. Particularly, the baseline results of the main estimation model, the test results for internal validity of the econometric method, and the results for robustness tests yield the same results in this replication as in the article. \n"

    "\n",
    "    * Other potential drivers of the underrepresentation of femeales in politics:\n",
    "        - Political parties influence election outcomes. Thus, underrepresentation might be caused by *anti-female party biases*.\n",
    "        - Parties might *anticipate anti-female voter bias* and, therefore, are less willing to field female candidates in competitive races.\n",

    "## 2. Descriptive and Graphical Analyses\n",
    "This section presents a descriptive summary of the data set which is provided by the authors. First, the coverage of the data set is described, i.e., how many council and mayor elections are observed for what number of municipalities and other rather superficial properties. We will have a look at the compositions of this data set, particularly in relation to the subsample of female council candidates which will be of increased interest throughout article and, hence, for this replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will try to make sense of observable discontinuities in observations. When inspecting the data set, in particular the observations for margin of victory and rank improvement combinations, noticeable discontinuities in both dimensions can be seen. This is especially interesting, because these discontinuities lead to stacked observations in a scatter plot which, in term, make it hard to judge if there is a discontinuity around the cutoff value of margin of victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section concludes with a summary of the insights that can be gained from this very top level descriptive approach as well as the finding, that a discontinuity around the cutoff yet needs to be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Description of the Dataset\n",
    "The data set contains observations on 1721 mayor elections. This includes the margin of victory as well as the gender of the mayoral candidates. Out of these 1721 elections, 268 are classified as a *mixed gender election*. The term *mixed gender election* is defined by the authors as \"mayor elections \\[where\\] the top two candidates were of opposite gender\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, observations on the election results of 109.017 council candidates are provided. When only those council candidates are kept in the sample which ran at an election that was preceded by a mixed gender mayor election, a total of 23.169 council candidates is observed. For each of these candidate's individual characteristics like gender, education and occupation as well as their success in the council election is observed. Success in a council election is measured by the normalized rank improvement, which will be looked at in more detail in subsection 2.2.\n"

    "Figure 3 displays the rank improvement of a female council candidate and the MoV of a female mayor in the preceding mixed-gender mayor election. Since a lot of observations are stacked on top of each other and to prevent the figure from being too cluttered, a random sample of 10% of all available observations is plotted. Looking at the distributions of observed combinations, a pattern of horizontally as well as vertically aligned data points is revealed. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, since the authors work with a data set that contains rank improvements of each female council candidate for a given result of the preceding mayor election, discrete changes in the horizontal dimension, i.e. for mayor election results, are no surprising considering the limited number of observed mayor elections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the discrete distribution of values in the vertical dimension can be explained when a closer look is taken at the distribution of council sizes: As previously described, rank improvements are normalized using the respective size of the council. While the authors do not provide data on the council sizes, this value can easily be deduced from the given values for absolute and relative gains in list ranks for the candidates. As presented in figure 4, sizes of the 214 observed councils are distributed over relatively few values and are clustered at certain values. In addition, 95% if all councils have not more than 45 seats. \n",

    "### 2.3. Discontinuity at the Critical Value of the Margin of Victory\n",
    "Considering figure 3, it is not very obvious if there is a discontinuity around the critical value of margin of victory (i.e. a margin of 0). A jump in values on the ordinate, however, might not be visible in this graphical representation. As discussed previously, observations are not distributed continuously but instead show strong discontinuities. This might result in a lot of observations being stacked on top of each other, hence not being represented in above plot. However, this problem should be mitigated by plotting only a small fraction of 10% of all observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing, a discontinuity around the cutoff can still not be ruled out. Hence, in another approach we will have a look at binned data. By plotting data tuples of the mean values of both, the margin of victory as well as the rank improvement, a discontinuity should be revealed (if there is any). This is because stacked observations will still have an impact of equal size on the mean values within each bin. In the next section, this approach of plotting binned data will be pursued further.\n",

Hence, a more promising approach is presented by the authors in *Figure 2: Rank Improvement of Female Candidates* of the article which is an RDD-plot for binned normalized rank improvements. A replication of this RDD-plot is displayed in figure 5 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this plot, first, the running variable (female mayor candidate margin of victory) is limited o values from -30 to +30 %. This allows to focus on the part of the data which is most relevant for this analysis. Second, the authors decide to bin the observations into clusters of 3 percentage points width of the running variable. Third, local polynomial regression of the underlying observations is added (red line) estimating the relation of both variables. Finally, the pointwise 95% confidence intervals are illustrated as black lines."

    "The regression discontinuity plot reveals a discontinuity at the cutoff value, i.e. a MoV of 0. Since a python package for the calculation of confidence intervals of a local polynomial regression is currently not available, I calculate pointwise confidence intervals. The results of this graphical analysis can be seen as a confirmation of the existence of a discontinuity at the cutoff value which is argued by the authors.\n",

    "\n",
    "After previous section provided graphical evidence on the existence and the extent of the discontinuity in rank improvements around the cutoff value of the MoV, this section replicates the results of a regression discontinuity analysis that aims to estimate the causal effect of a female mayor on success of female council candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the estimation of the effect of a female mayor on the success of a female council candidates, two different approaches are presented. The first relates gender of incumbent mayor to the normalized rank improvement of female candidates (i.e., normalized rank improvements are endogenous). The second relates gender of incumbent mayor to the likelihood that an elected member of the council in the same municipality is female (i.e. a dummy that equals 1 for council members that are female is endogenous).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both regressions are performed using different bandwidths and functional forms. For this replication, I will focus on the main specification (highlighted in bold font) which is the basis for the discussion in the article.\n",

    "* b) functional form:\n",
    "    - **linear**\n",
    "    - quadratic\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the optimal CCT bandwidth is used for the quadratic specification resulting in five specifications in total. The second approach results in insignificant results while point estimates seem to be in line with the results of the first approach. Since the subsequent discussion in mainly based on the first specification it will be calculated by default in the following cells. Note that the results for different bandwidths can easily be reproduced by adjusting the *bw* variable in subsequent code cells. \n",

    "In this specification normalized rank improvements are endogenous in the margin of victory of a female mayor, a dummy that takes value 1 if a female won the mayor election and an interaction term of both, margin and dummy. The regression model is illustrated in equation (3) below. In this notation, $i$ denotes one female council candidate. The dummy $D_{f\\_mayor, i}$ takes value 1 if the mayor in charge at the time of the council election is female. Finally, $MoV$ denotes the margin of victory of the female mayor candidate. Note that for values bigger 0 for $MoV$, $D_{f\\_mayor, i}$ takes value 1 and vice versa. \n",

    "#### 3.2.2 Robustness\n",
    "In order to evaluate the robustness of their baseline results, the authors present two different approaches: First, a placebo test and, second, a test for different scalings of the outcome variable. The authors argue that, overall, the baseline results show to be robust to both of these checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.2.1 Placebo Test\n",
    "The placebo test is described to check whether past values of the outcome variable \"can be explained by contemporaneous values of the treatment variable\". Applied to the analysis presented in the article, this translates to a test for statistically significant correlations between the gender of the mayor in council election period $t$ and the rank improvements of female council candidates in period $t-k$. The authors argue that \"if the female mayor dummy has a significant effect on the rank improvements of women in past elections, this would call our baseline estimates into question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Time lag $k$ is chosen to be five by the authors, which amounts exactly to the time between two council elections ([Hessian Municipal Code §36](http://www.lexsoft.de/cgi-bin/lexsoft/justizportal_nrw.cgi?t=156459931255666006&sessionID=1855059091299078653&chosenIndex=Dummy_nv_68&templateID=document&source=context&source=context&highlighting=off&xid=146137,46)). This assumption is not discussed in the article, although it is somewhat questionable since the regular period of office of a mayor in Hesse is six years ([Hessian Municipal Code, §39](http://www.lexsoft.de/cgi-bin/lexsoft/justizportal_nrw.cgi?xid=146137,50)). By setting $k=5$ the authos ensure that a mayor is in office for at most one year before the council election takes place. Thus, mitigating effects on anti-female voters bias arguably are quite low. At the same time, one could argue that the effects of a female mayor on anti-female voters bias might be particularly large right after the mayor's election while media coverage of the mayor might be especially broad and while the election itself is not in the too distant past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, as shown in the next cell, only for 40% of the observations used in the placebo test, the mayor is in charge for less than five years at the moment the council election takes place. In other words, voters have been exposed to the same mayor in the council election in year $t$ that was already in charge during the council election in year $t-5$ in 60% of the observations. Hence, the results of the placebo test as it is presented by the authors might be imprecise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the placebo test as it is depicted in the article is replicated. Subsequently, leaving the scope of a replication for a moment, a placebo test based on a stricter data selection than the one presented by the authors is carried out. Both these analyses are conducted using the placebo dataset (\"dataset_with_lagged_rank_improvments.dta\") which is provided by the authors. This dataset contains information on the mayor's gender and MoV at time $t$ as well as results for the council election in $t-5$."

    "Summarizing the results of the placebo test, the following can be concluded:\n",
    "First, the estimation results of a placebo test as it is presented in the article, particularly in table A.8 of the online appendix (see figure 8 below), can be replicated. In accordance to the argument in the article, the point estimate of this estimation shows to be relatively small in comparison to the main results. But more importantly, they do not show statistical significance and even reveal changes in signs for different bandwidths. This is seen as supporting evidence for robustness of the main results. \n",

    "\n",
    "Second, following above discussion of the term duration of mayors in Hesse and, consequentially, excluding all observations for which the mayor at time $t$ was in office for five or more years, does not lead to substantial differences in results. While in this specification there is no change in signs of the point estimate of the female mayor dummy, estimates still do not show statistical significance. \n",

    "##### 3.2.2.2 Scaling of the Outcome Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second robustness test, the authors test whether the results of their analysis are sensitive regarding changes in the scaling of the outcome variable, i.e. the rank improvements of council candidates. As illustrated in section 2.2 of this notebook, the authors use normalized rank improvements in order to facilitate interpretability of the results as well comparability of changes in rank for different council sizes. Assessing robustness with regard to this scaling, alternative specifications of the regression model are presented using (a) raw rank improvements and (b) a dummy variable that takes value 1 if a candidate experienced a strictly positive rank improvement. Estimations for both specifications will be replicated in succeeding cells."

    "### 3.3 Internal Validity of the RD Design\n",
    "Establishing internal validity is a prerequisite of the regression discontinuity design to be able to identify treatment effects in the same way a randomized trial does (Jacob et al. 2012). Therefore, it is crucial to rule out a non-random distribution of observations around the cutoff value of the treatment variable. In the context of the replicated article this means that municipalities around the cutoff value in the margin of victory of the mayor must not systematically differ in their characteristics. In other words, we need to rule out other drivers and channels through which a correlation between the rating variable (i.e. the margin of victory) and the outcome (rank improvements) might arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Pretreatment Municipality Characteristics\n",
    "The first test of validity the authors present adresses whether the RD design truly achieves a local randomization around the cutoff. If this is the case, then both, municipalities that are just below the cutoff of MoV = 0 and those just above this threshold should show the same distribution of characteristics. This is investigated using a t-test for differences in means of these characteristics in the year before the mayor election. Subsequently, a regression analysis is used to test for a correlation of the municipalities characteristics prior the mayor election and the elected mayors' genders. If observations are truly randomized around the cutoff value, we should not see any correlation between these characteristics and the mayors' genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step, we will have a look at the municipalities' characteristics one year before a mayor election and perform a t-test to explore whether there are differences between municipalities in which a male candidate won the mixed-gender election and municipalities in which a female won the mixed-gender mayor election. This comparison will be performed for all mixed-gender elections as well as for close those mixed-gender elections only (i.e., with a margin of victory below 10%).\n"

    "In comparison to the results of this analysis which are presented in table A4 by the authors (see figure 10 below), small differences can be seen. It is possible to replicate the results presented by the authors if, instead of considering the municipalities' characteristics of the *year preceding* the mayor election, one considers the characteristics of the *same year* as the mayor election. The results shown in this notebook, however, are calculated in accordance to the intuition discussed earlier: We want to find out, whether the RD design truly results in a local randomization, hence the municipalities closely around the cutoff must not significantly differ in characteristics that might have an impact on the outcome of a mixed gender mayor election. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering municipalities' characteristics of the year preceding the election will result in slightly different results than the ones presented by the authors. The authors argue, that when considering \n",
    ">all mixed-gender races, the share of women in local public employment \\[row log_female_sh_gem_besch\\] is 8 percent higher, while in the manufacturing sector \\[row log_female_share_prod\\] it is 8 percent lower in municipalities with female mayors. For close mixed-gender elections, we find only one significant difference: municipalities with female mayors have larger populations \\[row log_bevoelkerung\\] than municipalities with male mayors. Yet, the effect is only barely significant and may be explained by the highly skewed distribution of city sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This replication is able to confirm these results with regard to the close mixed-gender elections. For all mixed-gender elections, however, no significant differences can be found comparing characteristics for one year before the election. Results of this test for differences in means show to be quite sensitive with respect to small changes in the year for which characteristics are observed. Particularly, estimations including all mixed-gender mayor elections change drastically (i.e. show significance for different characteristics) for small changes in the year for which these characteristics are observed. This limits robustness of these results, especially since one should not expect a characteristic like, e.g., the share of women in the manufacturing sector to change very rapidly from one year to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when assessing whether the local randomization around the cutoff truly is achieved, differences in characteristics of municipalities with close mixed-gender elections should be investigated in greater detail. Thus, the significant difference in population sizes of municipalities closely on either side of the cutoff really is what should be concerning when evaluating the internal validity of the RD design. Additionally, this difference shows to be robust with regard to changes in the year that is observed. Nevertheless, the authors argue that: \n",
    ">\"Yet, the effect is only barely significant and may be explained by the highly skewed distribution of city sizes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, mixed results can be drawn from this analysis. While the authors argue that differences are rather small and might arise from a skewed distribution, it cannot be precluded that differences in characteristics (i.e. population sizes) have an impact on the distribution around the cutoff. This, particularly, holds for municipalities closely around the cutoff value. In case population size truly impacts the rating of municipalities around the threshold, the local randomization cannot be held on to. In consequence the RD design is likely to yield biased estimates for the causal impact of the treatment (Lee 2008). For this reason, I present further investigations on this aspect of local randomization in section 4 of this notebook, succeeding the replication of the article.\n",

    "Subsequently, the authors analyze whether differences in municipalities are able to explain a discontinuity in rank improvements of female council candidates. This is done in two consecutive steps:\n",
    "1. Municipalities' characteristics are used to predict normalized rank improvements of council candidates.\n",
    "&rarr; See whether municipalities' characteristics have explanatory power on rank improvements.\n",
    "2. These prediced rank improvements are used as an endogenous variable in a RDD regression.\n",
    "&rarr; Can municipalities' characteristics explain a discontinuity in rank improvements?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these steps are replicated in the following cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, municipalities' characteristics are used to predict normalized rank improvement. The calculations in the article are resembled exactly by including all observations (*bw = 100*). However, it might by more relevant to check whether rank improvements can be predicted for municipalities in which the margin of victory is close to the cutoff value for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We want to preclude that differences in characteristics of municipalities lead to a non-random local distribution of municipalities around the cutoff.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. We say earlier, that differences in municipalities' characteristics show more significance for close mixed-gender elections (i.e., those that end up closely to the cutoff) than for all mixed-gender elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the analysis presented in the article, in particular table A5 of the online appendix, the following estimation, thus, does not include all mixed-gender elections but focusses of those with an absolute margin of victory (MoV) smaller then 10."

    "At this point, noticeable differences in results arise between the article and this replication. As seen in figure 11 below, the authors do not find a statistically significant estimate for the *female_mayor* dummy. However, the specification presented above does indicate a significant discontinuity in predicted normalized rank improvements around the cutoff at the 1% significance level. Indeed, the point estimate for the *female_mayor* dummy results to be approximately 2.63, which translates to circa 0.82 ranks for the median council size. To illustrate the scale of this effect: This amounts to approximately 71% of the size of the estimated effect for the main model (see section 2.2.1: Regression Results).\n",

While the authors find no significant discontinuity and, thus, do not reject a successful local randomization by the RD design, the results presented in this notebook cannot support this conclusion. In contrast to the conclusions drawn in the article, this analysis does not preclude a non-random distribution of the rating variable around the cutoff value. Indeed, these results indicate that municipalities' charateristics for the *year before* the close mixed-gender election happened (i.e. *pretreatment*) are associated with the rank improvements of a female council candidate.\n",

The result of this test can be seen in figure 12 below (figure A.2 in the article's online appendix). It is little surprising that a discontinuity cannot be found. Indeed, it is highly implausible that a council candidate can choose into treatment by raising the MoV of a mayor candidate to be just above the threshold of 0.\n",

    "The results of this validity test can successfully be replicated. Just like presented by the authors, there is significant differences in the probability of a woman to win the mayoral election for large bandwidths, i.e. when not only close mixed-gender elections are considered. The significance in this difference, however, cannot be seen for mixed-gender elections with a MoV of 10% or lower.

    "The final concern the authors adress in the regard of internal validity are confounding effects due the political identity of mayors and council candidates. This might arise if males and females differ in their party affiliation. For example, female politicians might be more likely to be affiliated with left-wing parties. In this case, the success of a female council candidate in a municipality with a female mayor might be driven by their similar political affiliation and trends in general popularity of political ideologies, rather than a decrease in anti-female voters bias.\n",

    "In the article, this is approached by testing for differences in ideology of female and male mayors. Results of this test are provided in table A.7 of the online appendix and can be found in figure 14 below. Again, the authors investigate both, the whole sample of mixed-gender mayor elections and a subsample of those with a MoV smaller 10%. Overall, differences in the ideology of mayors in mixed-gender elections do not show statistical significance. Hence, it is implausible to argue that election outcomes of council candidates are related to these differences.\n",

    "The estimation results of this model reveal noticeable differences to the results presented for the baseline model. First, the estimation for the female mayor dummy is not significant in this estimation. Hence, the discontinuity in rank improvements at the cutoff is not significant for this estimation. Second, the only predictor that is significantly correlated with the outcome is the population size of the municipality. Third, the adjusted R-Squared is increased by approximately 50% in comparison to the baseline model. Changes in the bandwidth result in changes in the adjusted R-squared. However, this 50% increase appears to mark a lower bound.\n",

Generally, optimal bandwidths throughout this article range from 15 to 20. These results are very little affected by changes in the bandwidth.\n",

Including population size as a covariate in the estimation model results in a non-significant discontinuity while increasing the adjusted R-Squared. Finally, without a random assignment into treated and untreated groups around the cutoff, the internal validity of an RD design must be taken into question, hence causal inference looses credibility in the RD design (see Lee, 2008 for a discussion)."

    "## 5. Conclusions\n",
    "The replication of the baseline results of Baskaran & Hessami (2018) presented throughout this notebook yields exactly the same results as the authors present in their article. In addition to the results of the baseline model, I also (mostly successful) replicate the results presented on robustness tests as well as tests for internal validity of the regression discontinuity design. Furthermore, the scope of a mere replication is left at several points and additional analyses on the internal validity of the RD design are presented. The results of this work can be summarized as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it was possible to replicate the baseline estimations. Using the data set as it is provided by the authors, a weighted linear regression yields the exact same results that are presented in section *IV Main Results* of the article. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I was able to replicate the results of the tests for robustness of these baseline regression results, in particular a placebo test as well as a test for different scalings of the outcome variable. In the context of the placebo test, I additionally present results of an even stricter specification. This specification addresses a potential weakness of the placebo test implemented in the article regarding an overlap of the tenure of a mayor and the time lag chosen by the authors. However, the results of the placebo test are not affected by this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, at least two of the three presented results of tests for the internal validity can be confirmed by this replication. That is, the results of the test for a discontinuity in density as well as for a confoundedness of council candidates with the mayor's ideology can be confirmed by this work.  Yet, the outcome of the replication regarding the pretreatment municipality characteristics needs to be carried out in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "One (minor) difference between the test results presented in the article and the outcome of their replication is based on a difference in coding. For the intuition of a pretreatment analysis it is argued that characteristics of municipalities which are respectively just below or barely above the cutoff value of the rating variable should be compared for a time before the treatment is in place. That is, before a close mixed-gender election was won by either candidate. Hence, the results presented in this notebook stem from a comparison of characteristics in the year before the mayor election. In the article, however, differences are calculated for the same year as the mayor election.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more important difference in results, however, can be found in the succeding analysis. Here, municipalities' characteristics are used to predict rank improvements of council candidates. While the authors perform this analysis for all municipalities with mixed-gender mayor elections, I argue that a more relevant insight would result by focusing on close mixed-gender elections, only. Contrary to the results presented by the authors, including only this smaller set of municipalities indeed results in significant estimates for some of the characteristics, including the municipalities' population size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, the resulting predicted rank improvements are tested for a discontinuity at the cutoff value of the rating variable. Again, in contrast to the results presented in the article the alternative specification presented in this notebook yields a significant estimate of relevant magnitude for this discontinuity. In particular, the main results indicate a discontinuity of approximately magnitude 3.7 while the point estimate for this discontinuity takes a value of circa 2.6 for the alternative specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results, I propose a modified specification of the original regression model which includes population size as an additional predictor. An estimation of this specification yields a positive and significant coefficient for population size, indicating a positive association of population size and the normalized rank improvements of female council candidates, even within a small bandwidth around the cutoff value of the rating variable. Additionally, this specification does not result in significant estimations for the effect of a female mayor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of these regression analyses put a question mark on the internal validity of the RD design presented by the authors. However, further investigations on this particular aspect of the relationship between rank improvements of female council candidates and the population sizes of municipalities would be needed to take a final position on the relation between female mayors and success of female council candidates. \n",
