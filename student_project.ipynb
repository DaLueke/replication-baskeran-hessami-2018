    "# Replication Baskaran & Hessami (2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This replication is work in progress, tentative and incomplete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a replication of Baskaran, T., & Hessami, Z. (2018) Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics? *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 10(3): 91-121.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, first, data and method used as well as the key results are summarized briefly. Second, descriptive and graphical analyses are presented in preparation of third, a replication of the key results of the paper which is accompanied by critical review of the results presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Excecutive summary of the paper\n",
    "* **Observation:** *Anti-female voter bias* results in **underrepresentation of females in politics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Research Hypothesis:** Exposure to a female mayor deminishes *anti-female biases* of voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Other potential drivers of this observation:\n",
    "        - Political parties influence election outcomes. Thus, underrepresentation might be caused by *anti-female party biases*\n",
    "        - Parties might anticipate *anti-female voter bias* and, therefore, are less willing to field female candidates in competitive races.\n",
    "        - Women who expect discrimination might be reluctand to run for election/ pursue a career in politics in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Isolating *anti-female voter bias*: Rule out alternative explanations\n",
    "        - (a) Initial ranks of candidates does not impact their rank advancements\n",
    "        - (b) Characteristics of women on party's list chage only little in case there is a female mayor in office\n",
    "        - (c) Number of female candidates on list remains unchanged\n",
    "        - (a), (b), and (c) indicate little *anti-female party bias*\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Data on local council election in the German state of Hesse.\n",
    "        - Open-list electoral system (parties specify order of candidates, voters can preferential votes to individual candidates).\n",
    "        - Includes gender, list ranks, personal characteristics among other information for ~109.017 candidates who competed in 2001, 2006, 2011, or 2016 elections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Data on mayor elections for all 426 municipalities in Hesse, including the elected mayor's gender and the margin the election was won by.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Authors use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal effects of female mayors on subsequent council election results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The discontinuity is provided by close mixed-gender mayoral elections.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * estimated model equation: \n",
    "     > $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t} = \\alpha + \\beta female \\, mayor_{i, t} + f(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + female \\, mayor_{i, t} \\times  g(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + \\epsilon_{k, i, t}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where \n",
    "         - $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t}$ is the normalized rank improvement of candidate $k$ in municipality $i$ and local election year $t$.\n",
    "         - $vote \\, margin_{i, t}$ is the margin of victory of the female candidate in the preceeding mayoral election (negative values, thus, denote a loss of the female candidate).\n",
    "         - $female \\, mayor_{i, t}$ is a dummy that takes value 1 if a female candiate has won the mayoral election preceeding the council election $(female \\, mayor_{i, t} = 1,$ *iff* $vote \\, margin_{i, t} > 0)$.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     **TODO:** This is probably the appropriate place for the causal graph representing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Results:**\n",
    "    * A female candidate winning a close mixed-gender mayoral election causes...\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - voters to give preferential votes to female council candidates.\n",

    "        - a 4 percentage points higher share of female council members.\n",
    "        \n",

    "Figure 1 displayes all available combinations of the rank improvement of a female council candidate and the margin of victory od a female mayor a preceeding mixed gender election. Looking at the distributions of observed combinations, a pattern of *horizontally as well as vertically aligned datapoints* is revealed. First, since the authors work with a dataset that contains the rank improvements of each female council candidate for a given result for the preceeding mayoral election, discrete changes in the horizontal dimension are to be expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the discrete distributionof values in the vertical dimension (along the ordinate) can be explained when a closer look is taken at the distribution of council sizes: As previously described, rank improvements are normalized using the respective size of the council. While the authors do not provide data on the council sizes, this value can easily be deduced from the given values for absolute and relative gains in list ranks for the candidates. As presented in figure 2, sizes of the 214 observed councils are distributed over relatively few values and are clustered at certain values. In addition, 95 % if all councils have not more than 45 seats. It, thus, seems plausible to observe a discrete distribution of normalized rank improvements, given the discussed distibution of council sizes which will cause the denominator for the value on the ordinate to be the same for a large number of observations.\n"

    "A clear discontinuity around the cutoff value of the margin of victory of 0, however, is hard - if at all - to spot in figure 1 presented above. This might be due to the very noisy representation caused by plotting every single observation. Hence, a more promising approach is presented by the authors in *Figure 2. Rank Improvement of Female Candidates* of the article: A RDD-plot for binned normalized rank improvements. A replication of this RDD-plot is displayed in figure 3 below.\n",

    "In this plot, first, the running variable (female mayor candidate margin of victory) is limited o values from -30 to +30 %. This allows to focus on the part of the data which is most relevant for this analysis. Second, the authors decide to bin the observations into clusters of 3 percentage points width of the running variable. Third, local polynomial regression of the underlying observations is added (red line) estimating the relation of both variables.\n",
