    "# Replication Baskaran & Hessami (2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer: This replication is work in progress, tentative and incomplete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a replication of Baskaran, T., & Hessami, Z. (2018) Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics? *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy*, 10(3): 91-121.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose, first, data and method used as well as the key results are summarized briefly. Second, descriptive and graphical analyses are presented in preparation of third, a replication of the key results of the paper which is accompanied by critical review of the results presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Excecutive summary of the paper\n",
    "* **Observation:** *Anti-female voter bias* results in **underrepresentation of females in politics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Research Hypothesis:** Exposure to a female mayor deminishes *anti-female biases* of voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Other potential drivers of this observation:\n",
    "        - Political parties influence election outcomes. Thus, underrepresentation might be caused by *anti-female party biases*\n",
    "        - Parties might anticipate *anti-female voter bias* and, therefore, are less willing to field female candidates in competitive races.\n",
    "        - Women who expect discrimination might be reluctand to run for election/ pursue a career in politics in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Isolating *anti-female voter bias*: Rule out alternative explanations\n",
    "        - (a) Initial ranks of candidates does not impact their rank advancements\n",
    "        - (b) Characteristics of women on party's list chage only little in case there is a female mayor in office\n",
    "        - (c) Number of female candidates on list remains unchanged\n",
    "        - (a), (b), and (c) indicate little *anti-female party bias*\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Data on local council election in the German state of Hesse.\n",
    "        - Open-list electoral system (parties specify order of candidates, voters can preferential votes to individual candidates).\n",
    "        - Includes gender, list ranks, personal characteristics among other information for ~109.017 candidates who competed in 2001, 2006, 2011, or 2016 elections\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Data on mayor elections for all 426 municipalities in Hesse, including the elected mayor's gender and the margin the election was won by.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Authors use a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to study the causal effects of female mayors on subsequent council election results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The discontinuity is provided by close mixed-gender mayoral elections.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * estimated model equation: \n",
    "     > $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t} = \\alpha + \\beta female \\, mayor_{i, t} + f(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + female \\, mayor_{i, t} \\times  g(vote \\, margin)_{i, t} + \\epsilon_{k, i, t}$\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Where \n",
    "         - $rank \\, improvement_{k, i, t}$ is the normalized rank improvement of candidate $k$ in municipality $i$ and local election year $t$.\n",
    "         - $vote \\, margin_{i, t}$ is the margin of victory of the female candidate in the preceeding mayoral election (negative values, thus, denote a loss of the female candidate).\n",
    "         - $female \\, mayor_{i, t}$ is a dummy that takes value 1 if a female candiate has won the mayoral election preceeding the council election $(female \\, mayor_{i, t} = 1,$ *iff* $vote \\, margin_{i, t} > 0)$.\n",
    "         \n",
    "     **TODO:** This is probably the appropriate place for the causal graph representing the model.\n",

    "This section presents a descriptive summary of the data set which is provided by the authors. First, the coverage of the data set is described, i.e, how many elections are observed for what number of municipalities and other rather superficial properties. We will have a look at the compositions of this data set, particulary in relation to the subsample of female council candidates which will be of increased interest throughout article and, hence, for this replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we will try to make sense of the observable discontinuities in observations. When inspecting the data set, in particular the observations for margin of victory and rank improvement combinations, noticeable discontinuities in both dimensions, abcissa and ordinate can be seen. This is especially interesting, because these discontinuities lead to stacked observations in a scatter plot which, in term, make it hard to judge if there is a discontinuity around the cutoff value of margin of victory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section concludes with a summary of the insights that can be gained from this very top level descriptive approach as well as the finding, that a discontinuity around the cutoff yet needs to be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Description of the Dataset\n",
    "The data set contains observations on 1721 mayor elections. This includes the margin of victory as well as the gender of the mayoral candidates. Out of these 1721 elections, 268 are classified as a *mixed gender election*. The term *mixed gender election* is defined by the authors as \"mayor elections \\[where\\] the top two candidates were of opposite gender\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, observations on the election results of 109.017 council candidates are provided. When only those council candidates are kept in the sample which ran at an election that was preceeded by a mixed gender mayor election, a total of 23.169 council candidates is observed. For each of these candidates individual characteristics like gender, education and occupation are observed as well as their success in the council election is observed. Success in a council election is measured by the normalized rank improvement, which will be looked at in more detail in subsection 1.2.\n"

    "Establishing internal validity is a prerequisite of the regression discontinuity design to be able to identify treatment effects in the same way a randomized trial does (Jacob & Zai 2012). Therefore, it is crucial to exclude a non-random distribution of observations around the cutoff value of the treatment variable. In this scenario this means that municipalities around the cutoff value in the margin of victory of the mayor must not systematically differ in their characteristics. \n",

    "In other words, we need to rule out other drivers and channels through which a correlation between the rating variable (i.e. the margin of victory) and the outcome (rank improvements) might arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 Pretreatment Municipality Characteristics\n",
    "The first test of validity the authors present adresses whether the RD design truly achieves a local randomization around the cutoff. This is investigated by testing for a correlation of the municipalities characteristics prior the mayor election (hence the name \"pretreatment\") and the elected mayors' genders. If observations are truly randomized around the cutoff value we should not see any correlation between these characteristics and the mayors' genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step, we will have a look at the municipalities' characteristics one year before a mayor election and perform a t-test to explore whether there are differences between municipalities in which a male candidate won the mixed-gender election and municipalities in which a female won the mixed-gender mayor election. This comparison will be performed for all mixed-gender elections as well as for close those mixed-gender elections only (i.e., with a margin of victory below 10%).\n"

It is possible to replicate the results as presented by the authors if, instead of considering the municipalities characteristics of the *year preceeding* the mayor election, one considers the characteristics of the *same year* as the mayor election. The results shown in this notebook, however, are calculated in accordance to the intuition discussed earlier: We want to find out, whether the RD design truly results in a local randomization, hence the municipalities closely around the cutoff must not significantly differ in characteristics that might have an impact on the outcome of a mixed gender mayor election. \n",

For close mixed-gender elections, we find only one significant difference: municipalities with female mayors have larger populations \\[row log_bevoelkerung\\] than municipalities with male mayors.

However, by adjusting the *bw* variable, this can easily be changed. In fact, it might by more relevant to check whether rank improvements can be predicted for municipalities in which the margin of victory is close to the cutoff value for two resons:\n",

The regression model is illustrated in equation (\\ref{eq2}) below. In this notation, $i$ denotes one female council candidate. The dummy $D_{f\\_mayor, i}$ takes value 1 if the mayor in force at the time of the council election is female. Finally, $MoV$ denotes the *margin of victory* of the female mayor candidate. Note that for values bigger 0 for $MoV$, $D_{f\\_mayor, i}$ takes value 1 and vice versa. \n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, observations are weighted using their distance to the cutoff value of zero for the margin of victory. Lower weights are attached to observations farther away from the cutoff value. Thus, observations very close to the cutoff will have a weight close to 1. At the same time, observations where the size of the margin of victory close to the size of the bandwidth will have a weight close to 0. "
