    "For this purpose, first, I present a executive summary on the research hypothesis, analysed data and the method used for this purpose. However, I strongly recommend that one reads the original article prior to reading this notebook. Second, descriptive and graphical data analyses are presented. This is useful for understanding and making sense of the data that is used for the empirical analysis and serves as a preparation for the third and main part of this notebook: A replication of the key results of the paper. Besides the baseline results of the main model this includes econometric analyses regarding the internal validity of the used method as well as the robustness tests presented in the article. Finally, the fourth section of this notebook concludes the results of this exercise.\n",

    "The data set contains observations on 1721 mayor elections. This includes the margin of victory as well as the gender of the mayoral candidates. Out of these 1721 elections, 268 are classified as a *mixed gender election*. The term *mixed gender election* is defined by the authors as \"mayor elections \\[where\\] the top two candidates were of opposite gender\".\n",

When only those council candidates are kept in the sample which ran at an election that was preceeded by a mixed gender mayor election, a total of 23.169 council candidates is observed. For each of these candidates individual characteristics like gender, education and occupation are observed as well as their success in the council election is observed. Success in a council election is measured by the normalized rank improvement, which will be looked at in more detail in subsection 1.2.\n"

    "#### 3.2.2 Robustness\n",
    "In order to evaluate the robustness of their baseline results, the authors present two different approaches: First, a placebo test and, second, a test for different scalings of the outcome variable. The authors argue that, overall, the baseline results show to be robust to both of these checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.2.1 Placebo Test\n",
    "The placebo test is described to check whether past values of the outcome variable \"can be explained by contemporaneous values of the treatment vaiable\". Applied to the analysis presented in the article, this translates to a test for statistically significant correlations between the gender of the mayor in council election period $t$ and the rank improvements of female council candidates in period $t-k$. The authors argue that \"if the female mayor dummy has a significant effect on the rank improvements of women in past elections, this would call our baseline estimates into question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Time lag $k$ is chosen to be five by the authors. This assumption is not discussed in the article, although it is somewhat questionable since the regular period of office of a mayor in Hesse is six years (Hessian Municipal Code, 2015). By setting $k=5$ the authos ensure that a mayor is in office for at most one year before the council election takes place. Thus, mitigating effects on anti-female voters bias arguably are quite low. At the same time, one could argue that the effects of a female mayor on anti-female voters bias might be particularly large right after the mayor's election while media coverage of the mayor might be especially broad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, as shown in the next cell, only for 40% of the observations used in the placebo test, the mayor is in charge for less then five years at the moment the council election takes place. In other words, voters have been exposed to the same mayor in the council election in year $t$ that was already in charge during the council election in year $t-5$ in 60% of the observations. Hence, the results of the placebo test as it is presented by the authors might be imprecise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the placebo test as it is depicted in the article is replicated. Subsequently, a placebo test based on a more strict data selection is carried out. These analyses are conducted using the placebo dataset (\"dataset_with_lagged_rank_improvments.dta\") which is provided by the authors. This dataset contains information on the mayor's gender and MoV at time $t$ as well as results for the council election in $t-5$.\n",

    "### 3.3 Internal Validity of the RD Design\n",
    "Establishing internal validity is a prerequisite of the regression discontinuity design to be able to identify treatment effects in the same way a randomized trial does (Jacob & Zai 2012). Therefore, it is crucial to exclude a non-random distribution of observations around the cutoff value of the treatment variable. In this scenario this means that municipalities around the cutoff value in the margin of victory of the mayor must not systematically differ in their characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to rule out other drivers and channels through which a correlation between the rating variable (i.e. the margin of victory) and the outcome (rank improvements) might arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Pretreatment Municipality Characteristics\n",
    "The first test of validity the authors present adresses whether the RD design truly achieves a local randomization around the cutoff. If this is the case, then both, municipalities that are just below the cutoff of MoV = 0 and those just above this threshold should show the same distribution of characteristics. This is investigated using a t-test for differences in means of these chracteristics in the year before the mayor election. Subsequently, a regression analysis is used to test for a correlation of the municipalities characteristics prior the mayor election (hence the name \"pretreatment\") and the elected mayors' genders. If observations are truly randomized around the cutoff value we should not see any correlation between these characteristics and the mayors' genders.\n",

It is possible to replicate the results as presented by the authors if, instead of considering the municipalities characteristics of the *year preceeding* the mayor election, one considers the characteristics of the *same year* as the mayor election. The results shown in this notebook, however, are calculated in accordance to the intuition discussed earlier: We want to find out, whether the RD design truly results in a local randomization, hence the municipalities closely around the cutoff must not significantly differ in characteristics that might have an impact on the outcome of a mixed gender mayor election. \n",

Yet, the effect is only barely significant and may be explained by the highly skewed distribution of city sizes.\n",

    "This replication is able to confirm these results with regard to the close mixed-gender elections. For all mixed-gender elections, however, no significant differences can be found comparing characteristics for one year before the election. Results of this test for differences in mean shows to be quite sensitive with respect to small changes in the year for which characteristics are observed. Particularly, estimations including all mixed-gender mayor elections change drastically, showing significance for different characteristics for changes in the year for which these charactersitics are observed. This limits robustness of these results, especially since one should not expect a characteristic like the share of women in the manufacturing sector to change very rapidly from one year to the next.\n",

While the authors argue that differences are rather small and might arise from a skewed distribution, it cannot be precluded that differences in characteristics (i.e. population sizes) have an impact on the distribution around the cutoff. This, particularly, holds for municipalities closely around the cutoff value. In case population size truly impacts the rating of municipalities around the threshold, the local randomization cannot be held on to. In consequence the RD design is likely to yield biased estimates for the causal impact of the treatment (Lee 2008). For this reason, I present further investigations on this aspect of local randomization in section 4 of this notebook, succeeding the replication of the article.\n",

    "The estimation results of this model reveal noticable differences to the results presented for the baseline model. First, the estimation for the female mayor dummy is not significant in this estimation. Hence, the discontinuity in rank improvements at the cutoff is not significant for this estimation. Second, the only predictor that is significantly correlated with the outcome is the population size of the muicipality. Third, the adjusted R-Squared is increased by approximatly 50% in comparison to the baseline model. Changes in the bandwidth result in changes in the adjusted R-squared. However, this 50% increase appears to mark a lower bound.\n",

    "Since a python package for optimal bandwidth selection is not available, estimation results were calculated using an array of different bandwidths. This can be adjusted by modifying above cell. The currently chosen bandwidth of 15 is used since it fits in the range of different bandwidths that are presented for the authors for different estimations, which generally was from 15 to 20. These results are very little affected by changes in the bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a comparison of characteristics of municipalities that lie respectively just below or above the cutoff value indicates that a local randomization might not have been achieved. In particular, population size appears to have explanatory power on the election success of female council candidates. Including population size as a covariate in the estimation model results in a non-significant discontinuity while increasing the adjusted R-Squared. Finally, without a random assignment into treated and untreated groups around the cutoff, the internal validity of an RD design must be taken into question, hence causal inference looses credibility in the RD design (see Lee, 2008 for a discussion)."
